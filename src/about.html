        <p class="text-light ms-5 about-text">My development career started in college around 2020. I love design and
            think that being able to translate my designs into code makes me feel like I am contributing on another
            level. With my college experience I have worked on projects that had me deal with all kinds of languages and
            frameworks.
            Some of these include <b class="highlighter">HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vue.js, Python, C++, Java, Python, Ruby,
                Django, Ruby on rails, SQL, and Bootstrap </b>. I want to continue broadening my programming skills and
            want to pursue a career where it is still a vital thing in my day-to-day.</p>

                class="icons me-3">Designer</h1>
        <p class="text-light about-text ms-5">Design is the reason that I opted to gravitate towards the front end of
            the web industry. Since I was in Jr. High and experiencing Photoshop for the first time I have loved
            creating and discovering my own style and designs. Through trial and error over the last 8+ years I have
            loved discovering the creative process and have explored software such as <b class="highlighter">Adobe
                Photoshop, Adobe Premiere Pro, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Lightroom cc, Adobe XD, and Figma.</b> I hope to
            continue to perfect my design skills, and want to tailor it towards companies who are looking for help with
            the appeal and functionality of the designs.</p>

                class="icons me-3">Creator</h1>
        <p class="text-light about-text ms-5">Being someone who loves to create something from the original idea all the
            way to the final deliverable, I have dabbled in all sorts of side projects over my life. These have provided
            an outlet for me to unleash and perfect my creative process. Some of the things that helped me make my
            creative skills more well rounded include <b class="highlighter">professional photographer, professional
                videographer, content creator, Twitch streamer, YouTube video creator, and graphic design work.</b> All
            of these things have helped me discover new and emerging software and I continue to pursue future interests
            such as animation and 3D.</p>
